Upgraded Hoppers is a simple Vanilla+ mod adding new faster hoppers that can be upgraded from previous tiers. From the 8-tick Vanilla Hopper to the new 1-tick Netherite Hopper.

Currently, that's as simple as it is, each tier lowers the transfer speed by 1 tick.
<br>This is my first mod, and mostly just an experiment, but I hope to add new features over time.
<br><br>Some ideas I had but can't guarantee implementation of:
<ul>
<li>Copper Hopper oxidation, each oxidation level doubling the transfer speed. (Sounds useless, but slower hoppers could prove useful for redstone contraptions) This would come with waxable copper hoppers.</li>
<li>Multi-item transfer, instead of moving one item at a time, move multiple for every "transfer" (Maybe some sort of item input slot for the "stack upgrade"?)</li>
<li>Instant Hoppers (Beacon Hoppers?) 0 tick transfer speed, used in a chain would funnel the items from the top connection immediately to the last. (Would need to ensure no loops exist, for obvious reasons) This idea would nullify the Multi-item concept and may be too unbalanced. Possibly a good idea for an add-on mod?</li>
</ul>
