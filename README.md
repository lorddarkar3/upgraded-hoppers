Upgraded Hoppers is a simple Vanilla+ mod adding new faster hoppers that can be upgraded from previous tiers. From the 8-tick Vanilla Hopper to the new 1-tick Netherite Hopper.

<br><br>Beacon Hoppers are the most powerful of the hopper tiers.<br>
Rather than funnel items through each hopper, it searches for the last Beacon Hopper in the hopper chain and directly deposits items there.
Note that the Beacon Hopper technically has a 1 tick delay, but due to the chaining mechanic this essentially means it transfers one item to the end of the chain per tick (x amount of hoppers = 1 tick)
Due to the way Beacon Hoppers work, it is not possible to place a hopper below one to funnel items out that aren't directly funneled downward. (This will be fixed in a later version)

<br><br>This is my first mod and mostly just an experiment, but I hope to add new features over time.
<br><br>Some ideas I had but can't guarantee implementation of:
<ul>
<li>Copper Hopper oxidation, each oxidation level doubling the transfer speed. (Sounds useless, but slower hoppers could prove useful for redstone contraptions) This would come with waxable copper hoppers.</li>
<li>Multi-item transfer, instead of moving one item at a time, move multiple for every "transfer" (Maybe some sort of item input slot for the "stack upgrade"?) </li>
</ul>
